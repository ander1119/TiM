            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Trope in Movies (TiM) comprises (1) 684 movies, each annotated with per-shot keyframes, subtitles, and trope labels, and (2) 95 trope identification queries accompanied by their definitions.</p>
            <p>TiM is designed as a testbed for exploring two critical yet previously overlooked video reasoning skills: (1) Abstract Perception: understanding and tokenizing abstract concepts in videos, and (2) Long-range Compositional Reasoning: planning and integrating intermediate reasoning steps for managing long-range videos with numerous input.</p>
